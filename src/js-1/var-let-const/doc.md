# Variable Declarations in JavaScript

JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. Understanding their differences is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code.

> Let's find about var , let and const.

## var

- `var` is function-scoped and can be hoisted.
- It can be re-declared and reassigned.

## let

- `let` is block-scoped and can be reassigned, but not re-declared in the same block.

## const

- `const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned or re-declared.
