## ===

- Strict equality compares two values for equality. Neither value is implicitly converted to some other value before being compared. If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal. If the values have the same type, are not numbers, and have the same value, they're considered equal.

## ===

- The == and != operators in javascript are used to compare two values. The == operator checks if two values are equal. The != operator checks if two values are not equal.

- It is also known as the loose equality operator because it checks abstract equality, i.e., it tends to convert the data types of operands in order to carry the comparison when two operands aren't of the same data type.
