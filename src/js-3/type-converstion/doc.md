## Type conversion

- Type conversion, on the other hand, is the explicit act of converting a value from one data type to another using built-in functions or operators.

- Type casting means transferring data from one data type to another by explicitly specifying the type to convert the given data to.

```Javascript
var str = "42";
var num = Number(str); // Conversion: string to number
console.log(num); // Output: 42
```
